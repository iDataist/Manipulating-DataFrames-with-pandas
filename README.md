# Manipulating DataFrames with pandas

- Extracting and transforming data: index, slice, filter, and transform DataFrames

- Advanced indexing: extract data with multiIndexes, or hierarchical indexes

- Rearranging and reshaping data: reshape DataFrames using pivoting, melting, stacking, and unstacking

- Grouping data: split DataFrames by groups or categories for further aggregation or analysis

- Case study: work with the Summer Olympic games data that goes as far back as 1896
