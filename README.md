# Manipulating DataFrames with pandas

The data analysis is documented in [Manipulating_DataFrames_with_pandas.ipynb](https://github.com/iDataist/Manipulating-DataFrames-with-pandas/blob/master/Manipulating_DataFrames_with_pandas.ipynb). The raw data files are also stored in the repository. 

- Extracting and transforming data: index, slice, filter, and transform DataFrames

- Advanced indexing: extract data with multiIndexes, or hierarchical indexes

- Rearranging and reshaping data: reshape DataFrames using pivoting, melting, stacking, and unstacking

- Grouping data: split DataFrames by groups or categories for further aggregation or analysis

- Case study: work with the Summer Olympic games data that goes as far back as 1896
